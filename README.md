# foo_strm

[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) supports simple, one item playlists, containing a single URL to stream. This tiny component adds
support for `.strm` files.

`.strm` are basically text files with `.strm` extension with URL inside:

```text
http://radiojazzfm.radiokitstream.org/radiojazzfm.mp3
```

If you save this line as "RadioJazzFm.strm" file, you cand open it in Kodi and play the stream. `Foo_strm` plugin allows doing the same in [foobar2000](http://foobar2000.com/), assuming that stream format is supported. 

See more details about `.strm` files [here](https://kodi.wiki/view/Internet_video_and_audio_streams#The_.STRM_file_method:).

## Installation

Download latest `foo_strm.fb2k-component` from [releases](https://github.com/Messere/foo_strm/releases) page and double click it to open in foobar2000.
